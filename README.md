Project Title: Daikibo Factory Downtime Analysis

The Problem: "I was given a JSON file with telemetry data from 4 factories. The goal was to find out (1) Which factory had the most downtime, and (2) Which machines broke most often in that factory."

My Process: "I used Tableau to import and analyze the data. I created a calculated field to quantify 'downtime' and built two bar charts to visualize downtime per factory and per device. Finally, I combined them into a dashboard with a filter action."

The Final Dashboard:
